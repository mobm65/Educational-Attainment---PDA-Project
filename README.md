# Educational-Attainment---PDA-Project
Investigating correlations between achievement; parental education, attendance and plans to attend 3rd level.
I predict there is a link between the variables; school attendance, mother's education, father's education, plans to attend 
higher education and achievement.  I will use the dataset produced by Cortez and Silva which includes these variables among others.
First I will import the dataset and eliminate the other variables until I have the ones I want to investigate.
